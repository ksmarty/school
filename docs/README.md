> A repository of all my school assignments & notes

## Create a new assignment

1. Copy `template.mdx` to your chosen directory.
2. Use the [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) extension to convert for submission.


Use vercel serverless to generate PDFs. Add a "download as PDF" button to each page as well as buttons on this page for each class.

Add an index page to each class that lists assignments/notes and any code files.
