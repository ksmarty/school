## Learning Objectives Reflection

When I last reflected on my learning objects four months ago, I said that I had gained a better knowledge of databases. Since then I have continued to learn more and my knowledge has expanded even further. However, I would say that this particular objective has since been expanded.

Moving beyond databases, my focus has grown to encompass more layers than just the raw data. In my current project, there are three main layers that have my attention: Business, Logical, and Physical. Business is the layer with which I have the least amount of experience. I still do not fully understand it, but I know that it will be important once I have a mastery of the other two. Physical is simply another term for the database. Logical, however, is my primary focus of the project and of new learning. The logical layer is an abstraction of the physical layer. It strips away all of the technical specifications and just leaves the most important details. It's two main focuses are structure and content; how are things laid out, and what are their attributes. 

The main struggle I've had in this new directive is distinguishing the layers. What separates the three of them and what do they each bring to the table? Physical is quite clear, but the other two are somewhat ambiguous. I'm undergoing a lot of training but it doesn't seem as though there are clear definitions. 

Going forward, I think the best strategy is to take advantage of all of the resources at my disposal. Both reading online and speaking to those more knowledgeable than myself will hopefully give me the skills I need to both complete this learning objective as well as the project. I'm quite confident I'll be able to accomplish this and learn a great deal in the process.

## Work Term Reflection

I've found the transition somewhat easy. I didn't take a gap year, so prior to my placement, I had been in school for 14.5 years continuously. This afforded me somewhat of a break from the more formalized learning of school. In addition, Sanofi has had nearly all staff working remote since before I joined. This meant that I didn't have to transition back to working/studying in person. They adapted to work-from-home very well and the on-boarding was a lot smother that I anticipated. All of these factors combined, culminated in a fantastic transition from school to work that I would have no qualms about encouraging others to experience.

In the first half of my third year, prior to the start of my placement, I took a course called EECS3421: Introduction to Database Management Systems. Despite not having an incredibly flashy name, it was nonetheless incredibly informative. The course mostly focused on theoretical knowledge more than application. At the time, I thought this to be an incredibly fruitless endeavor and a waste of my time. Seeing as though it was part of my degree requirements, I trudged along and tried to do my best. I ultimately finished with a mark that I was happy with but still had a craving for more hand-on learning and/or an application of my newly acquired knowledge. Lo and behold, that what I got just a few months later. In quite a surprise to me, my main assignment at my placement has been the documentation of a central database. I've had to apply nearly everything I learned in Database Management Systems to the real world. From reading database flow and UML diagrams to writing and understanding SQL queries, I've gotten quite the use out of my knowledge. It has been an invaluable asset to me and would have made my current job much more difficult having to learn an entire course worth on content on the fly. It is by far in my top 5 most useful courses, despite thinking I wouldn't use half of what I learned.

Sanofi's corporate culture, from what I've experienced, is a very progressive one. People are very understanding and forward thinking. From personal experience as well as discussions from my peers, management at this level is fantastic. You are treated like a real person and not just a number. I feel like part of a team and everyone wants everyone else to succeed. This works really well with my style as I do a lot better when I'm able to work on my own but with the support of others. I know that if I ever run into an issue, somewhere will find the time to help me, no matter how busy they are.

## Skill Reflection

S (Situation) - Where were you when this happened? (e.g. Working as a Software Developer Intern at  
BlackBerry in the Application Development Department). When did it happen? (e.g. This past summer)  
• T (Task) - What specific question, problem or challenge were you facing at the moment?  
• A (Actions) - What steps did you take to do a good job? What style did you use? What policies/  
procedures/theories, principles did you apply? This should be the longest part of the answer. Make sure you  
keep your answer focused on your role using “I” instead of what the whole team accomplished “we”.  
• R (Results or Relate to Learning) - What happened because you did a good job? What positive impact did  
your actions have? What problem was avoided? Qualify and quantify your results whenever possible. If  
there wasn’t a positive result, what did you learn from the experience? What would you do differently if you  
encountered a similar situation in the future?
