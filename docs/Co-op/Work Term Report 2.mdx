## Learning Objectives Reflection

## Work Term Reflection

* I've fond the transition somewhat easy. I didn't take a gap year, so prior to my placement, I had been in school for 14.5 years continuously. This afforded me somewhat of a break from the more formalized learning of school. 
* Please select one of your academic courses and discuss how you have applied theories and concepts you   
  learned in class on the job. 
* How would you define the corporate culture at your employer and how does this relate to your personal work   
  style?
