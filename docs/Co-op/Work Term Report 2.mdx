## Work Term Reflection

I've found the transition somewhat easy. I didn't take a gap year, so prior to my placement, I had been in school for 14.5 years continuously. This afforded me somewhat of a break from the more formalized learning of school. In addition, Sanofi has had nearly all staff working remote since before I joined. This meant that I didn't have to transition back to working/studying in person. They adapted to work-from-home very well and the on-boarding was a lot smother that I anticipated. All of these factors combined, culminated in a fantastic transition from school to work that I would have no qualms about encouraging others to experience.

* Please select one of your academic courses and discuss how you have applied theories and concepts you   
  learned in class on the job. 
* How would you define the corporate culture at your employer and how does this relate to your personal work   
  style?

## Skill Reflection

S (Situation) - Where were you when this happened? (e.g. Working as a Software Developer Intern at   
BlackBerry in the Application Development Department). When did it happen? (e.g. This past summer)   
• T (Task) - What specific question, problem or challenge were you facing at the moment?   
• A (Actions) - What steps did you take to do a good job? What style did you use? What policies/   
procedures/theories, principles did you apply? This should be the longest part of the answer. Make sure you   
keep your answer focused on your role using “I” instead of what the whole team accomplished “we”.   
• R (Results or Relate to Learning) - What happened because you did a good job? What positive impact did   
your actions have? What problem was avoided? Qualify and quantify your results whenever possible. If   
there wasn’t a positive result, what did you learn from the experience? What would you do differently if you   
encountered a similar situation in the future?
